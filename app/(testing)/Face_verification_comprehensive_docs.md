### **Verification Flow Process**

#### **1. Face Registration Flow**
```
User Consent → Multi-angle Capture → Face Encoding Generation → 
Encryption → Database Storage → Verification Test
```

#### **2. Shift Verification Flow**
```
Location Verification → Face Verification → 
Success/Failure → Manager Override (if needed) → 
Audit Logging → Shift Action Execution
```

#### **3. Face Verification Process**
```
Camera Initialization → Face Detection → Quality Assessment → 
Liveness Detection → Photo Capture → Encoding Generation → 
Comparison → Confidence Scoring → Result
```
