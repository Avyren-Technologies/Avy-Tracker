Great question! Let me first check if biometric authentication is already implemented in the app startup/login flow, and then we can discuss how to implement it properly like WhatsApp.

Great! I found that there's already a `BiometricAuthWrapper.tsx` component. Let me examine it to see how it's currently implemented:

Now let me check where this `BiometricAuthWrapper` is being used in the app:

Perfect! Let me check how it's implemented in the main layout:

Now let me check the AuthContext to see how it handles the biometric authentication flow:

Excellent! Now I have a complete understanding of how biometric authentication is implemented. Let me explain the current flow and identify what needs to be improved:

## **üîç Current Biometric Authentication Implementation Analysis**

### **‚úÖ What's Already Working:**

1. **BiometricAuthWrapper**: Wraps the entire app and checks for biometric requirements
2. **Settings Integration**: All role settings pages have biometric toggles
3. **Authentication Flow**: Basic biometric prompt when required
4. **Storage**: Settings are saved in AsyncStorage

### **‚ùå What's Missing (WhatsApp-like Behavior):**

1. **App Startup Check**: No biometric prompt when app is reopened
2. **Session Management**: No integration with app state changes
3. **Background/Foreground Handling**: No biometric check when app comes to foreground
4. **Proper Flow Control**: The wrapper doesn't prevent dashboard access

## **ÔøΩÔøΩ How It Should Work (WhatsApp-like):**

### **Current Flow (Incomplete):**
```
App Start ‚Üí AuthContext ‚Üí Dashboard (if logged in)
```

### **Desired Flow (WhatsApp-like):**
```
App Start ‚Üí AuthContext ‚Üí Biometric Check ‚Üí Dashboard (if authenticated)
App Background ‚Üí Foreground ‚Üí Biometric Check ‚Üí Continue
```

## **üîß Implementation Plan:**

### **Phase 1: Fix Current Implementation**
1. **Fix BiometricAuthWrapper Logic**: Ensure it properly blocks access
2. **Add App State Handling**: Check biometric on app foreground
3. **Integrate with AuthContext**: Coordinate with login state

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
1. **Session Timeout**: Require biometric after certain time
2. **Background Detection**: Require biometric when app comes to foreground
3. **Fallback Options**: Allow users to use passcode/pattern

## **üí° Discussion Points:**

### **1. When Should Biometric Be Required?**
- **App Startup**: Every time app is opened?
- **Background/Foreground**: When switching between apps?
- **Session Timeout**: After X minutes of inactivity?
- **Manual Lock**: User can manually lock the app?

### **2. Fallback Options:**
- **Device Passcode**: Use device's PIN/pattern?
- **App Password**: Custom app password?
- **Skip Option**: Allow users to skip temporarily?

### **3. User Experience:**
- **Frequency**: How often should users authenticate?
- **Timeout**: How long should a session last?
- **Notifications**: Should biometric be required for notifications?

## **ü§î Questions for You:**

1. **Do you want biometric required every time the app starts?**
2. **Should it be required when switching between apps (background/foreground)?**
3. **Do you want a session timeout (e.g., require biometric after 30 minutes)?**
4. **Should users be able to skip biometric temporarily?**
5. **What fallback authentication methods do you prefer?**

## **üì± Current Status:**

The biometric authentication is **partially implemented** but **not fully functional** for the WhatsApp-like experience you want. The infrastructure is there, but it needs to be properly integrated with:

- **App lifecycle management**
- **Authentication state coordination**
- **Proper access blocking**
- **Background/foreground handling**

Would you like me to proceed with implementing the WhatsApp-like behavior, or would you prefer to discuss the specific requirements first?
