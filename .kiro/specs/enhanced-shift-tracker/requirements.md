# Enhanced ShiftTracker with Face Verification and Embedded Map - Requirements

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing ShiftTracker component with advanced biometric verification and location visualization capabilities. The enhancement includes face verification with liveness detection for shift start/end operations, an embedded map component showing current location and geofence boundaries, and a comprehensive face management system with OTP-based security.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Face Verification System

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to use face verification to start and end my shifts, so that my attendance is securely validated and prevents unauthorized shift operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee attempts to start a shift THEN the system SHALL trigger face verification with liveness detection
2. WHEN face verification is initiated THEN the system SHALL capture live camera feed and detect face presence
3. WHEN a face is detected THEN the system SHALL require eye blink detection for liveness verification
4. WHEN eye blink is detected (leftEyeOpenProbability < 0.3 && rightEyeOpenProbability < 0.3) THEN the system SHALL auto-capture the photo
5. WHEN photo is captured THEN the system SHALL compare face encoding with stored profile
6. WHEN face verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL proceed with shift start/end operation
7. WHEN face verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide retry options with guidance
8. WHEN verification fails 3 times THEN the system SHALL offer manager override option
9. WHEN face data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt it using Expo SecureStore

### Requirement 2: Face Registration and Management

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to register my face profile during initial setup, so that I can use face verification for shift operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new employee first accesses the system THEN the system SHALL require face registration
2. WHEN face registration is initiated THEN the system SHALL capture multiple face angles for better accuracy
3. WHEN face registration is completed THEN the system SHALL store encrypted face encodings securely
4. WHEN an employee accesses face settings THEN the system SHALL require OTP verification
5. WHEN OTP is verified THEN the system SHALL allow face profile management (view, update, delete)
6. WHEN face profile is updated THEN the system SHALL require re-verification of the new profile
7. WHEN face profile is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove all stored biometric data

### Requirement 3: Embedded Map Component

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to see my current location and work area boundaries on a small map, so that I can verify I'm in the correct location for shift operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ShiftTracker page loads THEN the system SHALL display a 150x150px embedded map
2. WHEN current location is available THEN the system SHALL show a custom location marker
3. WHEN geofence areas are defined THEN the system SHALL display polygon overlays on the map
4. WHEN employee is inside a geofence THEN the system SHALL show dynamic labels with area names
5. WHEN employee taps the map THEN the system SHALL expand to full-screen view
6. WHEN in full-screen view THEN the system SHALL provide close and refresh location buttons
7. WHEN location services are disabled THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error message
8. WHEN map fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide retry functionality

### Requirement 4: OTP-Based Settings Security

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to use OTP verification to access sensitive face configuration settings, so that my biometric data remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN employee accesses face configuration settings THEN the system SHALL request OTP verification
2. WHEN OTP is requested THEN the system SHALL send verification code to registered phone number
3. WHEN OTP is entered THEN the system SHALL validate code within 5-minute expiry window
4. WHEN OTP verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL grant access to face settings for 30 minutes
5. WHEN OTP verification fails 3 times THEN the system SHALL lock access for 15 minutes
6. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication for sensitive operations

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Shift Operations

**User Story:** As an employee, I want the shift start/end process to include both location and face verification, so that my attendance is accurately recorded with proper security measures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN employee starts a shift THEN the system SHALL verify both location (geofence) and face authentication
2. WHEN location verification fails AND employee has override permission THEN the system SHALL allow face-only verification
3. WHEN face verification fails AND location is valid THEN the system SHALL allow location-only verification with manager approval
4. WHEN both verifications fail THEN the system SHALL prevent shift operation and log the attempt
5. WHEN shift operation completes THEN the system SHALL store verification results in audit log
6. WHEN verification data is stored THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, location, and verification confidence scores

### Requirement 6: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As an employee, I want the face verification process to be fast and responsive, so that I can quickly start/end my shifts without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN face detection is active THEN the system SHALL use performanceMode: 'fast' for real-time processing
2. WHEN camera is initialized THEN the system SHALL complete setup within 3 seconds
3. WHEN face verification is processing THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
4. WHEN verification completes THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback within 2 seconds
5. WHEN camera resources are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup to prevent memory leaks
6. WHEN app goes to background THEN the system SHALL pause camera operations
7. WHEN app returns to foreground THEN the system SHALL resume camera operations

### Requirement 7: Offline Support and Sync

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to use face verification even when offline, so that I can start/end shifts in areas with poor connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN device is offline THEN the system SHALL use cached face encodings for verification
2. WHEN verification occurs offline THEN the system SHALL queue the verification data for sync
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync queued verification data
4. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN cached data is older than 7 days THEN the system SHALL require online verification
6. WHEN storage is full THEN the system SHALL remove oldest cached verification data

### Requirement 8: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As an employee, I want my biometric data to be handled securely and privately, so that my personal information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN face data is captured THEN the system SHALL process it locally without sending raw images to server
2. WHEN face encodings are generated THEN the system SHALL use one-way hashing algorithms
3. WHEN biometric data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt it with device-specific keys
4. WHEN face verification occurs THEN the system SHALL not log or store actual face images
5. WHEN employee requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL completely remove all biometric data
6. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL not store failed attempt images
7. WHEN audit logs are created THEN the system SHALL exclude personally identifiable biometric data
