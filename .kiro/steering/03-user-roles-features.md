## Feature Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Role-based routing after authentication
const routeUserToDashboard = (role: UserRole) => {
  switch (role) {
    case "employee":
      router.replace("/(dashboard)/employee/employee");
      break;
    case "group-admin":
      router.replace("/(dashboard)/Group-Admin/group-admin");
      break;
    case "management":
      router.replace("/(dashboard)/management/management");
      break;
    case "super-admin":
      router.replace("/(dashboard)/super-admin/super-admin");
      break;
  }
};
```

### Permission Validation
```typescript
// Middleware for feature access control
const checkFeatureAccess = (feature: string, requiredRoles: UserRole[]) => {
  return (req: CustomRequest, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    if (!req.user || !requiredRoles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ 
        error: 'Access denied',
        feature,
        userRole: req.user?.role,
        requiredRoles
      });
    }
    next();
  };
};
```

### Data Access Patterns
- **Super Admin**: Access to all companies and users
- **Management**: Access to own company data only
- **Group Admin**: Access to assigned employees only
- **Employee**: Access to personal data only

### Navigation Structure
Each role has a dedicated navigation structure defined in their respective `utils/navigationItems.ts` files:

- **Employee Navigation**: Personal features and self-service options
- **Group Admin Navigation**: Team management and approval workflows
- **Management Navigation**: Company oversight and advanced analytics
- **Super Admin Navigation**: System administration and cross-company management

### Security Considerations
- **Data Isolation**: Company-based data segregation
- **Role Validation**: Server-side role verification for all operations
- **Feature Flags**: Role-based feature availability
- **Audit Logging**: Track all administrative actions and approvals

This role-based architecture ensures proper access control while providing each user type with the tools they need to perform their responsibilities effectively.
