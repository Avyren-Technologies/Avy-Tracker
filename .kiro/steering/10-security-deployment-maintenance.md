# Security, Deployment & Maintenance

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with 7-day access tokens and 30-day refresh tokens
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) with strict permission validation
- **Multi-factor authentication** support for enhanced security
- **Token rotation** and automatic refresh mechanisms
- **Secure token storage** using Expo SecureStore on mobile devices

### Data Protection
- **Encryption in transit** using HTTPS/TLS for all API communications
- **Encryption at rest** for sensitive data in PostgreSQL database
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt with salt rounds
- **API rate limiting** to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
- **Input validation** and sanitization on all endpoints

### Privacy & Compliance
- **GDPR compliance** with data portability and deletion rights
- **Location data privacy** with user consent management
- **Company data isolation** ensuring multi-tenant security
- **Audit logging** for all administrative actions
- **Data retention policies** with automatic cleanup procedures

## Deployment Architecture

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local development with hot reloading
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for testing
- **Production**: Multi-region deployment with load balancing
- **Environment variables** for secure configuration management

### Infrastructure Components
- **Frontend**: React Native Expo app with OTA updates
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and caching
- **File Storage**: Cloud storage for documents and media
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for live updates and notifications

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Application monitoring** with performance metrics
- **Error tracking** and alerting systems
- **Database performance** monitoring and optimization
- **Security monitoring** with intrusion detection
- **User activity logging** for audit trails

## Maintenance Procedures

### Database Maintenance
- **Regular backups** with point-in-time recovery
- **Index optimization** for query performance
- **Data archiving** for historical records
- **Schema migrations** with rollback procedures
- **Performance tuning** and query optimization

### Application Updates
- **Over-the-air updates** for React Native app
- **Blue-green deployments** for zero-downtime updates
- **Feature flags** for gradual rollouts
- **Automated testing** before production deployment
- **Rollback procedures** for failed deployments

### Security Maintenance
- **Regular security audits** and vulnerability assessments
- **Dependency updates** and security patches
- **Access review** and permission audits
- **Incident response** procedures and protocols
- **Security training** for development team
